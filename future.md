# Fylkir Powers Future Work

Parts of the Fylkir Powers mod that might be in potential future work (or ideas for future work). CK3 is coming, so this might be a bit of back burner.

## AI extensions
Most (all?) of the mod parts are designed to be used through a player Fylkir. Future implementations might support AI Fylkirs.

### Fylkir Requests by members of the faith

**Request Money** Right now AI members of the faith are the only ones that can ask for money, and the Fylkir will get a letter, which can be responded to. In the future, a player under an AI Fylkir may ask for money.

**Request Healing** An AI or player can request healing from the Fylkir.

**Request Life** An AI or player can request additional life from the Fylkir.

### Startable Event Chains by the Fylkir

**Codify The Sagas** The Fylkir gathers vassal priests to create a grand text, which contains all scripture and knowledge within the Germanic religion. Costs 500 piety. Might be in the society below.

**Forge Magical Weapon** Create a weapon which the Fylkir may carry into battle. Might be in the society below.

**Forge Magical Item** Create an item (wrist, back, cloak, etc). Might be in the society below. RPG is showing.

### Society - The Valinn
The Valinn are a society of Germanic priests which venerate the Fylkir above all else. Even if the Fylkir chooses not the be a part of The Valinn, its members are utterly devoted to the Fylkir and are fanatical in carrying out his will upon the world. The society is small, and might be split out to another mod.
